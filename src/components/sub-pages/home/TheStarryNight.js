          From a painting that was supposedly just a study of a starry night to
          becoming an overnight sensation by an artist who is immortalized and
          remembered for cutting off his own ear. This is of course the beloved
          Vincent van Gogh, who painted The Starry Night (1889). In this
          article, we will discuss this painting in more detail by looking at
          why it was painted and the stylistic elements that have kept it
          swirling in all our memories.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although Vincent van Gogh was not a famous artist when he was alive,
          he left a legacy of artwork few, if any, can compare with. The Vincent
          van Gogh paintings collection is infused with the depth of his
          emotional, mental, and spiritual inner world. He was what we call a
          “tortured” artist and experienced considerable inner turmoil. His art
          depicts bright and colorful landscapes and objects with expressive and
          dynamic brushstrokes. Below we will explore how van Gogh brought his
          inner dimensions to life on his canvases, namely the painting The
          Starry Night (1889). We will first look at a contextual analysis and
          where van Gogh was at the time of painting this starry night. We will
          also discuss how van Gogh fit into the Post-Impressionist movement of
          the time.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lastly, we will provide a formal analysis of The Starry Night painting
          and place a telescopic view on the artist's utilization of color,
          form, and perspective. There is a lot happening and swirling in his
          iconic painting and all of it adds to The Starry Night's meaning. So,
          let us look further. When van Gogh painted The Starry Night in 1889,
          he was staying in the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole mental asylum in
          Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the southern parts of France. The preceding
          events leading up to his admission to the hospital were quite
          tumultuous and involved a confrontation with his acquaintance and
          fellow Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, and van Gogh cutting
          off a part of his own ear. He reportedly experienced a severe
          psychotic break after these events and would have various more.
          <br />
          <br />
          During his stay he had two rooms, one was a bedroom, and one was
          utilized as a painting studio. His subject matter was of the asylum
          and its surrounding gardens, although he was able to move around more
          than most of the other patients. His room, which was apparently
          east-facing, had a view of the French Alpilles mountain range, which
          inspired a lot of his landscapes. However, his painting studio did not
          have a view of the mountains, but it is believed van Gogh painted a
          lot from memory, imagination, and other artworks.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the 1880s, several artists moved away from the realists’
          approach of painting from nature and the world as they saw it. This
          approach is referred to as en plein air, which means “outdoors” in
          French. The Impressionists focused on portraying the real aspects of
          life and not so much the depiction of the more traditional and classic
          subject matter we see from Renaissance paintings. Colors and brushwork
          were more expressive and artists were not focused on the type of
          stylistic elements like symmetry, order, and form. It is often
          described as an optical form of art because artists focused on how
          they perceived the natural world and painted it accordingly. One of
          the leading figures during this new and revolutionary modern period of
          art was Claude Monet.
          <br />
          <br />
          There was no one set of rules for Post-Impressionists, which followed
          directly after, as they all approached their art in different ways and
          styles. However, a common thread was that artworks were generally more
          abstract and symbolic, not as focused on trying to depict the natural
          environment as the Impressionists were. Some artists like Paul Cézanne
          focused on how compositions relied on fundamental forms as he stated,
          “Treat nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone”. Artists
          like Paul Gauguin and van Gogh depicted their subject matter rooted in
          more emotional perspectives and symbolism. Gauguin developed a style
          called Synthetism, which referred to the “synthesis” of all the
          influencing elements of what makes the artwork. This includes the
          formal qualities of colors and lines, the external subject matter, and
          the subjective feelings of the artist, and as mentioned earlier in the
          case of van Gogh, can be derived from imagination and memory.
