          In the Sistine Chapel, hands become more than just hands. The Creation
          of Adam by Michelangelo is one of the frescoes that adorn this Vatican
          City chapel in Rome. It has been a familiar and sought-after sight for
          many around the world for centuries, which we will discuss in the
          article below.

          The Sistine Chapel tells a story to anyone who enters its space,
          physically or virtually. It is a treasure trove of frescoes, a home to
          hundreds of painted figures who are all part of a Biblical narrative,
          occupying its walls and ceiling. Let us take a brief tour of the
          Sistine Chapel to understand where The Creation of Adam by
          Michelangelo fits in. The Sistine Chapel, named “Cappella Sistina” in
          Italian, is in the Vatican City in Rome, Italy. It forms part of the
          Apostolic Palace, which is known as the “formal residence” of the
          Pope. Although the Apostolic Palace is where official religious and
          administrative practices take place concerning the Papacy, it is also
          a site of significant artworks and architecture, and home to the
          Vatican Museums. The Sistine Chapel was built from 1473 to around
          1480/1481 by the request of Pope Sixtus IV. Interestingly, the chapel
          was named after Pope Sixtus IV, the word “Sistine” derives from the
          Italian word sistino and is commonly defined as “of or relating to the
          Pope Sixtus”.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Sistine Chapel was a renovation project, rebuilding the site of
          the older Cappella Magna, which was close to ruin. Many sources about
          the history and design of the chapel refer to two architects, namely,
          Giovanni de Dolci and Baccio Pontelli. Pope Sixtus IV also
          commissioned several artists to paint the interior North and South
          walls; The North wall depicts the Life of Christ, and the South wall
          depicts the Life of Moses. Among the artists were Sandro Botticelli
          and Domenico Ghirlandaio. Below these panels, on either side, are what
          is known as “trompe l’oeil” draperies, which means they give the
          illusion of being real. These walls were also intended to hang real
          tapestries designed by Raphael, a commission made by Pope Leo X in
          1515. Raphael’s tapestries depicted the lives of Saint Peter and Saint
          Paul, and the designs were known famously as the Raphael Cartoons.
          There were originally 10 designs, however, only seven are left and on
          display at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) based in London.

          In 1508, Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to repaint the
          Sistine Chapel ceiling, it was originally painted in blue with golden
          dots denoting stars by Piermatteo D’Amelia. Reportedly, the Pope asked
          for a depiction of the 12 Apostles, but Michelangelo proposed a more
          elaborate subject matter, which resulted in what we see on the Sistine
          Chapel ceiling today. The Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo
          depicts several stories from the Old Testament in the Holy Bible. Just
          above each of the North and South walls are a series of lunettes,
          which depict the ancestors/forefathers of Jesus Christ. There are four
          large pendentives, which are triangular in each corner, depicting
          scenes about Israel’s salvation. Along the border of the ceiling, in
          line with the pendentives, we will notice smaller triangular shapes,
          commonly knowns as spandrels. These have been thought to depict more
          family/ancestors of Jesus Christ. In between the spandrels and
          pendentives, there are 12 figures of alternating Prophets and Sibyls
          all relating to their foreseeing of the coming of Jesus Christ. The
          next panel consists of what is known as the central paintings, which
          composes of nine horizontally shaped panels, which are grouped as
          threes and decorated with medallions and male nudes referred to as
          ignudi.
          <br />
          <br />
          The central stories are from the Bible’s Book of Genesis and are
          painted to be viewed starting from the altar, which is on the East
          side of the Sistine Chapel. The first group of three scenes is about
          the creation of the heavens and earth. These start with The Separation
          of Light from Darkness, The Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants, and
          The Separation of Land from Sea. Here, we see the strong and powerful
          figure of God actively dominant in the scenes.The next three scenes
          depict the creation of man painting scenes, namely The Creation of
          Adam painting, which we will discuss in more detail below. This is
          followed by The Creation of Eve and The Original Sin and Banishment
          from the Garden of Eden. The last three scenes depict the story of
          Noah, namely, The Sacrifice of Noah, The Flood, and The Drunkenness of
          Noah. This set of paintings is closer to the entrance of the chapel,
          which is on the West side
          <br />
          <br />
          An interesting point to note is that it is believed The Creation of
          Adam painting was inspired by the hymn titled Veni, Creator Spiritus
          by Rabanus Maurus. According to a translation from the Vatican, in the
          hymn’s third stanza it is written, as “finger of God’s right hand”, in
          Latin it is “dextrae Dei tu digitus”. Other translations describe it
          as the “finger of God’s hand”. If we look at the essence of it, it
          refers to God’s power as a creator of life. Additionally, in the art
          scholar Paul Barolsky’s article Michelangelo and the Spirit of God,
          published in Source: Notes in the History of Art (Volume 17, Number 4,
          1998), he connects the meaning of the word spiritus to “wind” or
          “breath”, which Michelangelo depicted in The Creation of Adam and the
          source of wind we notice in the drapery and hair.  Furthermore, God is
          almost like the breath of creation, His creation being Adam. Barolsky
          also mentions that Michelangelo could have found inspiration from
          Sandro Botticelli’s god of wind Zephyr in The Birth of Venus (c.
          1484-1486). There are similarities between the position of Zephyr’s
          body and God’s body, which appears to be floating in the air as if
          buoyed by the wind.
