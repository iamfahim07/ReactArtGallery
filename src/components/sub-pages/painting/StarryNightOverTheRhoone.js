          Starry Night Over the Rhône (1888) is one of Vincent van Gogh’s
          depictions of the nighttime and its colorful entrancement of light.
          This is what we will discuss in this article, exploring questions
          about when it was painted and Van Gogh’s artistic approaches.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vincent van Gogh painted Starry Night Over the Rhône when he lived in
          Arles, a city in southern France. He moved to Arles in February 1888
          from Paris, where he lived for around two years with his brother Theo
          van Gogh. In May of 1888, Van Gogh reportedly utilized the famous
          Yellow House, located on Place Lamartine, as a studio, which he would
          later move into and rent, during September 1888. The house had several
          rooms and he wished to use it as a communal space for other artists to
          stay and work. His friend and fellow artist Paul Gauguin visited in
          October 1888 and only stayed for around two months, abruptly leaving
          due to a fallout between the two artists. This was the time of the
          well-known incident when Van Gogh cut off part of his ear.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Rhône is a river with its starting point in the Swiss Alps, which
          flows through southern France and eventually into the Mediterranean
          Sea. This river was apparently only a walk away for Van Gogh from the
          Yellow House, which is when he painted Starry Night Over the Rhône. We
          can notice the banks of the river in the painting too. When he stayed
          in Arles, Vincent van Gogh wanted to paint a scene of the night sky.
          In several letters to others, he also expressed this desire and
          inclination to capture the night and its effects. The Rhône River
          scene was one of his desires to come true, depicting the effects of
          light at night. Reportedly Van Gogh sat outside while he painted this
          scene under a gas lamplight.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Starry Night Over the Rhône, Vincent van Gogh depicts a night scene
          from the embankment of the Rhône River. A vast night sky – illuminated
          by several small and big, bright, stars – makes up almost a third of
          the upper part of the composition. We see the town in the distance,
          across the river, also illuminated, not by starlight, but by its own,
          artificial, light scattered about and reflected on the rippled water
          in front of us, as if they are beams of light reaching from one bank
          to the other. In the foreground is the quay with several small boats
          and two figures near the right side facing us, the viewers. They
          appear to be having a relaxing walk along the riverbank. In a letter
          to his brother, dated 29 September 1888, Vincent van Gogh described
          these figures as “two colorful figurines of lovers in the foreground”.

          Color and light are important aspects of this painting and the subject
          of Van Gogh’s study. He noted the colors he utilized in the same
          above-mentioned letter to his brother, describing the sky as
          “aquamarine”, the water as “royal blue”, and the ground as “mauve”.
          Furthermore, he described the town in the distance as “blue and
          purple”, and “yellow” for the gas, and the reflections were a “russet
          gold descending down to green-bronze”. We can see the powerful play of
          light that Van Gogh depicted here, from the natural light above and
          the artificial light below. The blues and yellows are also
          complementary, emphasizing the brighter areas of light.The color value
          contributes to the lightness and darkness conveyed. There are lighter
          hues more to the center of the sky and darker hues to the edges.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vincent van Gogh utilized a variety of brushstrokes throughout this
          painting, from short and stocky for the sky to more thin and elongated
          strokes for the bank in the foreground. The brushstrokes are clearly
          visible on the canvas and create a rich textured composition,
          highlighting his free and expressive style of painting. This is also
          referred to as impasto, which is when the paint is thickly applied
          onto the canvas. If we zoom in on the painting, we will be transported
          to a more abstract world seemingly removed from any realism. We will
          come face to face with Van Gogh’s hand, how he applied each color and
          lick of paint, some areas thicker than others. However, the way Van
          Gogh applied his paintbrush and the resulting physical texture of the
          paint create a balance and unity in the composition.
